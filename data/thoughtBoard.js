        thought: "Jesus Christ died for me, Jesus Christ thought me worthy of His blood, and He loves me. He has hopes for me and He can make a difference in my life. His grace can transform me' and maybe this person sitting next to me ignoring me or even wanting to move away, maybe he or she doesn't. That doesn't change the reality of what Christ feels for me and the possibilities I have in Christ",
