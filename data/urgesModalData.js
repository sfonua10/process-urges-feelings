        question: "What is an urge?",
        answer: ["An urge is an emotion that is intensely driving you to do something. Other words for urges are cravings, wantings, and desire. The urge to view pornography is the emotion driving you to view porn so that your brain can be rewarded with dopamine, creating a temporary pleasure."]

        question: "Is what I‚Äôm feeling an urge?",
        answer: ["If you‚Äôre wanting to view pornography, or if you want to start viewing things that could lead to viewing pornography, that‚Äôs an urge."]

        answer: [
            "One of two things is probably going on:",
            "1. You‚Äôre not engaging in activities when you would normally want to view porn.",
            "2. You might be using distractions to keep you from feeling the urge. Remember. We are not afraid of the urge to view porn. It is not a bad thing. If you want to rewire your brain and change the habit, you will have to practice feeling the urge and choosing not to view the pornography anyway. In our world, we can not avoid pornography forever.",
            "But we can get really good at saying no to urges, and eventually getting rid of the desire to view it at all. It‚Äôs a skill that takes practice. Be careful that you‚Äôre not avoiding opportunities to practice."

        question: "How do I count an urge that lasts for a long time?",
        answer: [
            "If you‚Äôve waited for 10 minutes and the urge is still there, count that as one urge. If another 10 minutes passes, count that as another urge and so on. Remember to breathe through this process and go about life as usual, instead of just sitting and watching the clock."

        question: "My urges are super short, should I still count them?",

        question: "Where should I count my urges?",
        answer: [
            "It doesn‚Äôt matter, the most important thing is that you TRACK and PROCESS 100 WHOLE URGES. It‚Äôs life-changing. The worksheet included in the workbook is a great resource. You can also use the free app ‚ÄúCounter+‚Äù or any other counting app. Some of my clients like to use a jar and put in a bead or a bean everything they count an urge until they hit 100. You can be creative or simple. Whatever floats your boat."

        answer: [
            "First, breathe. You got this.",
            "Most people find that they have a 'witching hour'. A time where the urge feels the strongest because that is when your brain is used to viewing porn. For example, 10-12 pm, or 12-2 am, and after that it tends to subside. This is a good opportunity for you to be curious with yourself and see if you can pinpoint where your personal ‚Äúwitching hours‚Äù are.",
            "If you notice yourself debating whether or not you should view the porn, the urge will be prolonged. The more we flip flop about whether or not we should view the porn, the more ‚Äúclever‚Äù justifications our brains come up with for giving into the urge. You‚Äôll notice that the more committed you are to not view porn, the fewer urges you will have and the more quickly they will subside."

        question: "Is it ok to take up other activities when I would normally be viewing porn? Like going for a run or working on a project?",
        answer: [
            "Yes, but pay attention to whether or not you are distracting yourself from feeling the urge. Remember, to retrain your brain into not wanting the porn, you have to let yourself feel the urge and process through it, not just run away from it.",
            "If you find yourself filling up your time with activities to avoid the urge or avoid being with yourself, it‚Äôs probably a sign that you need to practice tuning into your mind and body."

        question: "I‚Äôm afraid to feel the urge.",
        answer: [
            "That is ok. You‚Äôre afraid of the urge because you think it‚Äôs powerful. It has no power over you unless you say yes. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre practicing here. We are learning a new skill, and it‚Äôs normal to experience fear when learning new things. Let yourself be afraid of the urge and then don‚Äôt view the porn. Show yourself that fear is never a reason to say yes, and is never a reason to give up. You‚Äôve got this. You are practicing teaching your brain that you are in control."
